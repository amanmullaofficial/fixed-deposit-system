This project will help you to manage the fixed deposits in the bank. The admin can create the n-number of employees in the database and they are added through the Employee section in the homepage of the dashboard.

The added employees are allowed to create, delete or modify the customer. Employees can create the various types of FD's (Fixed Deposit) as per the customer need, after creating a FD, the FD Certificate will be generated. Employees are also able to generate various types of reports as per their need.
